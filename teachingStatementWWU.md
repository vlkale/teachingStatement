The field of computer science to other areas of science or engineering
is relatively new. Computer Science has increasing its presence only
within the last 60 years. Other areas of sciences and engineering are
typically over 100s of years old. The rapid pace of innovation in the
area of computing in the last 60 years can make using the same
textbooks each year difficult, particularly in the areas of operating
systems and computer architecture areas. I believe teaching computer
science to entering undergraduates and Master’s students is a major
challenge today because of needing to balance (1) the large amount of
information in this field (2) its recency with little well-established
principles and (3) the rapid change each year in what topics are
important. The challenge must be handled in the context teaching
people with diverse prerequisite knowledge. 

       While teaching and research seems to be thought as very
       different, I believe teaching has further driven me to pursue
       research projects and be involved in the research community of
       high-performance computation. To teach the concepts that I
       learned myself only a couple of years ago has been a tremendous
       opportunity for me. It has reminded me of the fundamental
       concepts that I’ve learned in my upper-level classes, and given
       me insight on the assumptions that I make in my research
       projects.  Throughout my time as a graduate student, I have
       been a grader for a foundational mathematics courses for two
       semesters and a teaching assistant for a hands-on systems
       programming course for three semesters. The experiences in
       teaching has helped me hone my own skills in computer science
       and mathematics. Far more valuable has been the experience I
       have gained in presenting ideas in front of a large group of
       students. I have realized that there are many different ways to
       perceive fundamental concepts.  Rather than explaining my own
       understanding of some concept or solution, I have seen that one
       of the best ways to help students understand an idea or
       technique in computer science, e.g., AVL trees, TCP/IP,
       hashing, is to guide students in learning the concepts rather
       than asserting that these concepts are true. Students must see
       what motivates it, the advantages and disadvantages of it, and
       how it can be applied.

If I were an assistant professor at Western Washington and were teaching courses there,
I'd adopt the following teaching principles when teaching courses.


\underline{\bf Exams versus projects}: Exams are often used to test students'
skills and understanding of concepts. This seems to make sense for
large classes, where a standard for evaluation is necessary. But it
seems that the ability to solve problems and implement it in code is
one of the best ways to learn and also evaluate student's
understanding of the material. Moreover, students gain mastery in the
many different areas of computer science (perhaps with the exception
of a theory course) through implementation and programming. In some
cases, even writing a small 100-line C program can take a few hours
for students, particularly for debugging, testing, and ensuring all
errors are handled. Thus, it is important that when being a teaching
assistant or instructor in a computer science course, one be
understanding of this. Rather than giving 4 large programming projects
within a semester,  it seems beneficial to both the students and the
teachers that smaller assignments be given more often during the
semester.  In this way, students will gradually develop programming
skills through regular practice, and instructors or TAs can
continually evaluate and check students understanding of the student's
work. 


\underline{\bf Implementation and Experience}: In computer science, implementation and
experience with programming makes one a better computer science
student. Yet, what does it mean to have "7 years of programming
experience"?  It seems to me that the real questions should be "what
did you implement?", "what general problem were you trying to solve",
"What were the challenges you faced?"  and "what were the design
decisions in your code that you had to make?".  Having seen many
different students with different backgrounds in the large classes
that I'm involved with, the best students are those that can reason
about a problem in depth to find a solution through algorithm design,
implement it in some programming language and understand the
trade-offs involved in their implementation complexity, e.g., software
engineering, code complexity, and understand the implications of
performance, OS resource management (systems, architectures). The
students that are able to understand computer science at these
different levels, and can reuse the techniques they learn directly for
another problem, will be most successful. As an assistant professor at
WWU, I’d promote the style of solving a problem to its completeness in
such a way that the lessons learned can naturally be applied to other
problems and the students will have the initial tools to learn more on
their own quickly by solving one problem in depth. 

\underline{\bf Reasoning about programming languages}: At the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, the standard language used in most basic
undergraduate course is C. The course that does not use it is
"programming languages and compilers", but even this course is taught
using just one LISP-like functional language called OCAML. While using
C may make debugging more difficult, it seems that students are able
to apply the techniques they learn to other programming languages
thereafter. Students may know a wide range of programming languages,
from object-oriented languages to functional languages. Rather than
just knowing a variety languages, students should understand how to
learn the basics of and then evaluate a language, i.e., assessing
whether it is advantageous to use a language for real-world
problem. The language one uses to solve a problem should express the
functionality, logic, or algorithm in a concise manner, so that
computers can execute the functionality without unexpected
behavior. This is one of the key ideas of the course I was a teaching
assistant for, and I continue to believe that Computer Science
curriculum like WWU will benefit from teaching how to work with
computers in this way.
