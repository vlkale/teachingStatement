 Introduction: 
The field of computer science to other areas of science or engineering is relatively new. 
Computer Science has been increasing its presence only within the last 60 years. The first department in Cambridge 
Other areas of sciences and engineering are typically 100s of years old. 
Challenge: ….  
I believe teaching computer science to entering undergraduates and Master’s students is a major challenge today because of needing to balance:
(1) the large amount of information in this field
(2) its recency with little well-established principles and 
(3) the rapid change each year in what topics are important. 
The challenge must be handled in the context teaching people with diverse prerequisite knowledge. 
What I’d like to do: I present the way that my teaching style based on experiences in teaching, coursework, and teaching, grading. My hope is that you’ll be convince for why my teaching viewpoint and plans will be beneficial to my qualification for being an assistant professor at WWU.
